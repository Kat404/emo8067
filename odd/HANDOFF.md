# Session handoff — emo8067

Written 2026-10-15 at the end of a long session. Everything below is a claim with a source; anything marked **UNRESOLVED** is a real open item, not a reminder.

## What the project is

`emo8067` — a clean-room, free-software Intel 8086/8088 emulator, assembler and debugger in Rust, intended for Linux/macOS/Windows. Licence: The Unlicense. Pure-Rust core with no dependencies and `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`.

**Clean-room rule:** reverse engineering establishes *observable behaviour and specifications* only. No code is ever copied or transliterated from another emulator. When this project's own research and the silicon disagree, **silicon wins**, and the manual's own print is preserved and marked as an erratum.

## Where the tree stands

```
cargo test --workspace   5 + 114 + 93 + 0 passed, 0 failed
cargo clippy             0 warnings, 0 errors
cargo fmt --check        exit 0
HEAD                     314f493
```

Two gates, both live, both proved to fail when broken:

| Gate | Covers |
|---|---|
| `every_first_opcode_byte_the_8086_defines_decodes` | all 256 first opcode bytes, `probed == 256` literal, no exclusions |
| `every_modrm_digit_of_the_8086_is_an_instruction_or_a_named_hole` | 96 `(opcode, /digit)` pairs, `96`, `5` and `91` as literals, cross-checked in both directions |

Plus `python3 odd/research/verify_opcodes.py`, which guards the transcription of the manual into `documentation-guide.md` §1.3 and §1.4: exactly sixteen cells per opcode row, every flag cell inside the Table 2-18 legend. Verified by mutation, not just by passing.

## Completed units

`U1` opcode map re-transcribed · `U2` reject 80186-only encodings · `U3` repair the shipped core (6 defects) · `U4` group 1 on memory · `U5` segment and stack group · `U6` the remaining opcodes · `U7` segment override prefixes · `AUDIT-1` word wrap · `AUDIT-3` `8F` mod · `AUDIT-5` prefix recursion · `AUDIT-7` `BP` → `SS` · `F5` `REP` as a latch.

The core covers the whole 8086 instruction set including 24 undocumented opcodes the manual prints as `(not used)`. The 8086 has **no opcode holes**: all 256 first bytes decode.

## Open items, in the order they should be taken

### 1. CLOSED — string operations now honour the segment override on their source side

**Closed in `fe16b6c`.** `string_op_once` in `crates/core/src/exec.rs` read the `SI` side through `DS` unconditionally; it now reads `operand_seg(cpu)`, and the `shortcut:` comment that admitted the divergence is gone. The manual is explicit that the *only* thing a segment override cannot reach is the **destination** of a string instruction: Vol. 1, "the only exception is the destination operand of a string instruction which must be in the extra segment", and Vol. 2 p. 2-112 uses `REP MOVS DESTINATION, ES:SOURCE` as its worked example. `STOS` and `SCAS` are still ES-only; `MOVS`, `CMPS`, `LODS` now obey the override.

Introduced by `5bdb235` (U7), before the F5 baseline, and fixed after the F5 baseline.

The vacuous `every_permutation_of_the_prefix_bytes_reaches_the_same_state` is gone. It permuted all four segment overrides and still agreed, because the override could not influence anything. In its place: a test that puts one override on the `SI` side of `MOVS`/`CMPS`/`LODS`, a test that pins last-override-wins, a guard that `STOS`/`SCAS` stay in `ES`, and the order-independence claim kept over `F0 F1 F2 F3` only, the four bytes whose latches come from independent decode columns. Suite after the fix: 215 green (5 + 114 + 96).

### 2. `CX = 0` with `REP` — manual and silicon may disagree

The code runs **zero** iterations, following the printed manual, Vol. 2 p. 2-41: *"If CX is 0, the string instruction is not executed, and control goes to the following instruction."* The implementer was right and the brief I wrote was wrong. But silicon is widely reported to run one iteration. **Treat as a second erratum candidate, exactly as `A8`/`A9` was.** If silicon wins, `rep_with_a_zero_count_runs_no_iterations` and `a_rep_string_op_with_a_zero_count_executes_nothing` flip together.

### 3. Not checked, and each could hide a defect

- Jenner's microcode listing behind `POP rmw` — the `8F mod=11` claim rests only on his per-routine table.
- No Intel errata sheet was reachable for `A8`/`A9`; the §1.3 footnote ‡5 records the project's decision, not a fetched primary.
- The `FF` group's latch interactions have never been re-examined.
- No silicon `REP` with `CX = 0`.

### 4. CLOSED — stale briefs, marked rather than rewritten

Each contained a claim this work overturned. Reading one as current guidance would reintroduce a defect, so each file now carries one banner at the top naming the superseded claims, what is actually true, and the commit where it was settled. **The bodies are unchanged** — the stale claims stay as the record of what was believed, which is why the banners exist instead of edits. Four files, 21 inserted lines, 0 deletions:

- `odd/research/_brief-f5-rep-latch.md` — `CX = 0` does one iteration (manual says zero); `F3` negates an `IDIV` result (**void**: `F7 E1` is `MUL CX` and `mul_group` reads no flags); the eight-prefix-byte permutation claim.
- `odd/research/_brief-u6-remaining-opcodes.md:33-35` — silicon does not agree with the "80186 extension" reading of `84`/`85`; both are real 8086 instructions.
- `odd/research/_brief-u7-segment-prefixes.md` — `F2`/`F3` are prefix latches now, not dispatcher arms; `8F` takes `mod=00`, `01` and `10`.
- `odd/research/_brief-verify-f5-and-debt.md` — **not in the list above when this item was written**: the same three false claims appear again at ~lines 11-13. A worker found it while doing the other three.

Still open, and named by the work that did the banners: `documentation-guide.md` §1.3 footnote ‡3 and log entry L14 are marked "now the wrong documents" by `ec669a4`. Untouched.

### 5. `odd/research/_prompt-audit7-and-friends.md` is the single most valuable document here

A research prompt whose answers closed **four** audit items, two of which reversed decisions the parent had already committed. Reuse it as the template for any future architecture question to another model: it demanded a source hierarchy, asked claims to be labelled by how they were verified, and explicitly made *"not decidable from available sources"* a valid answer. That framing is why it found two things the parent and two verifiers had both missed.

## Five defects, one cause

Every architecture bug this project shipped came from the same place — **reasoning where a citation was required**:

| Defect | What was assumed |
|---|---|
| word wrap | the 8086 carries from the offset into the segment base |
| `PUSH`/`POP` following `DF` | if string operations move one way, the stack does too |
| `LEA` width | `8D` is odd, so bit 0 means byte |
| `CA`/`CB` immediate | the pairing was swapped |
| `BP` default segment | one default segment for every base |

Not one was found by the test suite. Every one was found by a verifier, a microcode disassembly, or a sourced research answer. **The green suite proves the tests pass, not that the emulator is right.**

## Three tooling hazards

1. **Do not splice Rust source with a Python script that counts braces.** Three attempts in this repo corrupted the file; one deleted an entire function body and left a signature with no parameter list. Use the `edit` tool, or a single targeted replacement whose `old` text was just read from disk, and run `cargo build` immediately.
2. **`edit` silently reverts six pre-existing lines** in `crates/core/src/exec.rs` to pre-rustfmt style. Run `cargo fmt` before every commit and confirm `cargo fmt --check` exits 0.
3. **Never `git checkout` a file a delegated agent just wrote but has not committed.** It destroyed a unit once; recovery meant resuming the agent's session. The agent now commits in stages, and each stage leaves the tree green.

## How this project got its findings

Every external finding arrived as a hypothesis to reproduce, never an instruction to execute — and each reviewer has reported at least one false claim:

- `A8`/`A9` reported as `TEST` — **false**, it is `CMP`. Not applied.
- My own U5 brief's `LAHF`/`SAHF` formulas — **false**. The implementer deviated deliberately and was right.
- My own F5 brief's `CX = 0` and `F3`-negates-`IDIV` — **both false**, caught by the implementer and the verifier.

Subagent discipline that worked: brief by file path, allowed edit surfaces enumerated, atomic commits with the gate in the same commit, and "report defects outside your scope, do not fix them".

## Next session, in order

1. ~~Fix the string-source segment override (item 1)~~ — done in `fe16b6c`; its replacement permutation test had to be written from scratch, because the F5 verification report it referred to is in neither memory nor the repo.
2. Decide item 2 with a primary source, and record it the way `A8`/`A9` was recorded.
3. ~~Correct the five stale briefs (item 4)~~ — done; four files carry banners, and a sixth document turned out to be wrong.
4. Then `T12`: the headless runner already exists at `crates/cli` (binary `emo8067`, with `--trace` and `--dump`); what remains is running the 86 shipped `.asm` examples, which needs `T13`, the assembler.
